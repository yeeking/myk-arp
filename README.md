Interpolating arpeggiator plugin

Another hacky weekend project to make a thing I want to use :) 

I was enjoying using my dominion synth's arpeggiator to shift from chord to chord in different ways.
Then I ended up layering progressions up in audio on my multitrack. 

This plugin (it'll probably be a plugin) represents that kind of workflow but with more powerful interpolation capabilities than the little arp on my dominion so I can do some nice gradual transformations between different chords and patterns. 

## Status:

Working on low level tests for the interpolation code at the moment. Don't hold your breath as its a hobby project.
